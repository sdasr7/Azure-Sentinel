<h1>Microsoft Azure Sentinel (SIEM)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In the course of my internship, I had the opportunity to dive deeper into honeypots and the use of SIEM(Rapid7) tools in order to get a better understanding. In spite of having put my classroom skills at my internship, to have more practice and hands-on experience in the Mircosoft Azure Cloud environment. My solution to this problem was to implement Microsoft Azure's Sentinel, which I am going to use in order to provide real-time logs for my vulnerable VM hosts in order to effectively set up a honeypot environment for them.
